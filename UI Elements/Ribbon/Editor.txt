Have an RootEditor component that retrieves state from the database:
    - if user is using the editor for the first time, show empty container with text
    telling the user to start dragging and dropping: by creating a new page
    - if users have used it before then redirect to first Editor
    - the new page form results are stored in the Editor component state
    - pass the page forms' as props to children
