there are 2 strategies: 
    1. render an array of containers and use relative position to position them 
    2. render an array of containers/elements and calculate which containers/elments are adjacent then style 
        them into a css grid

#1
--pros--
    a. easy to code
--cons--
    a. will make containers long and leave space at the bottom of the containers

#2
--pros--
    a. does not leave unneccessary space
--cons--
    a. more challenging to code

----STRATEGY----
create a Static Container
    container will take a dictionary of UINode children as a prop
    return an array of containers

    create a computeStyle(children) function a computes the relative position of each child in relation to each other
    computeStyle will return an object with styles for the container, and each child

{
    left: 25,
    top: 35,
    width: 100,
    height: 50,
}

{
    left: 35,
    top: 45,
    width: 100,
    height: 50,
}
